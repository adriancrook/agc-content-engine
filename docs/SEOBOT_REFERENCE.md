## What Is SEO Copywriting?
SEO copywriting is the practice of producing keyword-optimized content that's designed to appeal to human users and search engine algorithms. In other words: SEO copywriting is writing content that Google can understand. And, at the same time, that content needs to be the type of content that people want to read, link to and share.

<example>
Think content marketing's glory days are over? Here's something that might surprise you: **SaaS companies can still grow through content marketing.**. What's the secret? Original content. Original content refers to any content type that: **is unique**, **demonstrates out-of-the-box thinking**, and **provides additional value**, whether through new information, a different perspective, a detailed analysis, or something else entirely.
